                <h1>1.Wage and Salary Employment Percentage : Worldwide</h1>
                This scene shows the trend of worldwide average wage and salaried workers, % of total employment from 2000 to 2020.<br/>
                In the plot, it is evident that the proportion of wage and salary workers globally has been on the rise over the past 18 years, indicating a concurrent decline in the percentage of self-employed/unemployed workers.<br/>
                The data also indicates a slight decrease in the Wage and Salary Employment Percentage from 2019 to 2020. This decline is attributed to the impact of the pandemic, which led to job losses worldwide, resulting in a lower percentage of wage and salary employment during that period. <br/>
                In 2013, the Worldwide Wage and Salary Employment Percentage crossed a significant milestone by surpassing the 50% mark, making it another crucial benchmark for global employment trends.<br/>

                Moreover, the percentages of wage and salaried workers among the total, male, and female employees in the US all surpassed 90% during this period.<br/>

                The line chart displays the percentage of average wage and salaried workers in China's total employment from 2000 to 2020. <br/>
                Over this period, the rate exhibited a continuous upward trend. However, it has hovered around the global average and has not surpassed the 60% mark. <br/><br/>
                The data from the WDI indicator highlights that there is considerable scope for China to enhance this aspect of its workforce.

                The comparison between China, Russia, and the United States regarding the trend of average wage and salaried workers as a percentage of total employment from 2000 to 2020 reveals unexpected findings.<br/>
                Contrary to the assumption that China, like Russia, might have a similar situation due to both being ruled by communist parties, the data indicates otherwise.<br/>
                Russia's employment structure, as reflected in the chart, appears to be more comparable to that of the United States.<br/>

    <h4>About the indicator in WDI:</h4>
    <blockquote>
            The indicator of status in employment distinguishes between two categories of the total employed. These are: (a) wage and salaried workers (also known as employees); and (b) self-employed workers. Self-employed group is broken down in the subcategories: self-employed workers with employees (employers), self-employed workers without employees (own-account workers), members of producers' cooperatives and contributing family workers (also known as unpaid family workers). Vulnerable employment refers to the sum of contributing family workers and own-account workers. The series is part of the ILO estimates and is harmonized to ensure comparability across countries and over time by accounting for differences in data source, scope of coverage, methodology, and other country-specific factors. The estimates are based mainly on nationally representative labor force surveys, with other sources (population censuses and nationally reported estimates) used only when no survey data are available.
